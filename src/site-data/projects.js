        description: "This idea started when my wife and I decided to try counting macros. She had an application that she'd been using, but it wasn't exacty what she needed to get the job done. So I tried my hand at creating something that could acheive what she was looking for. If you want to try out the demo, login with 'Test_User_1' and 'Password1'.

        title: "Avalwyn Discord Bot",
        description: "I've shared a Discord server with a group of friends for a few years now. We play all kinds of Roleplaying Games, but we always come back to a shared Dungeons & Dragons universe we call Avalwyn. In an attempt to keep downtime fun for my friends, I built a 'faction-based-idle-gaming' Discord Bot using some of the characters from our shared universe. It was a lot of fun for a while, but eventually we stopped using it. Now, I've open sourced it, so that someone might pick it up and use the core code for a similar project. Built using The Serverless Framework, JavaScript, DiscordJS, Heroku, and AWS",

        title: "The Game Room",
        description: "The idea behind 'The Game Room' started in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. I wanted to make a website to mimic game night with my friends. You could join or host a lobby, pick a game, and let the fun begin. I left off this project mid-flight, but would love to come back to it again when I have more time. If you try the demo, you may have to refresh the page after loading in. Built using Angular, AWS, WebSockets, TypeScript, and Heroku.",

        description: "While working at NCR, I had a lot of ideas about improving the look and feel of the application I was working on. When I had some free time, I put together a quick mockup of what I thought it might look like. If you check out the demo, press the Checkout button to add a random item to the basket. Built using React, Redux, Bootstrap, and the Serverless Framework ",
